I grew up in a small town of just 750 people here in Missouri. I played a lot of sports in high school but also a lot of video games hints my love for technology. While I was still in high school I joined the Army National Guard and am still serving currently in college. I am working right now to go to Officer Candidate School next summer to become a commissioned officer in the Guard.
